# EmployeeTracker

This is a console application that use Node and Inquirer to Manage Employees.

The Database is MySQL. I have created the schema and seeded with initial data.

The app uses inquirer module to create prompts that can be used to manage different tasks such as view all employees, add roles etc.

Here are some screenshots of the application:
